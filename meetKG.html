            Glenn and Katie were on a debate team together in 
            high school. Glenn and Katie met at a debate 
            tournament December 11th, 2010. Glenn had a 
            crush on Katie in high school. Katie invited the 
            whole debate team to come watch her soccer game. 
            Only Glenn showed up. It was cold and rainy day 
            and they shared a jacket to keep warm. Glenn 
            attended many more of her soccer games before he 
            finally worked up the courage to ask her to be 
            his girlfriend. They started dating April 30th, 2012. 
            Glenn attended Mizzou the following year and Katie 
            moved away to Northwest. Even though they lived hours 
            apart they couldn't stay away from each other. On 
            July 16th, 2016 Glenn got on one knee in front of 
            friends and family at the JC Nichols fountain in 
            KC to ask Katie to marry him. Now they are asking you 
            to attend their long awaited wedding July 7th, 2018.
